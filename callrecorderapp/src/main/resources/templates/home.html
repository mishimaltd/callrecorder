        <h1 class="mb-4">Frequently Asked Questions</h1>
        <h4 class="mb-2">How does your service work?</h4>
        <p class="lead mb-2">We provide a simple automated call recording service that you can use to record any outgoing phone call in high-quality audio. To use our service you just need to:</p>
        <ol class="lead">
          <li class="mb-2">Register an account online. It's quick and easy.</li>
          <li class="mb-2">Call our toll free automated number.</li>
          <li class="mb-2">You will be asked to enter the number of the person you want to connect to on your telephone keypad followed by the '#' key.</li>
          <li class="mb-2">The service will read back that number to you and ask you to press '1' on your telephone keypad to confirm.</li>
          <li class="mb-2">The service will then connect you to that number. The person being called will see your number on the incoming call, not ours.</li>
          <li class="mb-2">At the end of your call just hang up and we'll send you an email with a secure link to your recording.</li>
          <li>You can access any of your call recordings at any time by going to your private account dashboard.</li>
        </ol>
        <h4 class="mb-2 mt-4">Can I try it out before registering?</h4>
        <p class="lead mb-2">Absolutely! You can try out our service for free by calling our toll-free trial number. At the end of your call we'll send you a text message with a link to your securely-stored recording.</p>
        <p class="lead mb-0">Our trial service is limited to a maximum call duration of five minutes, your call will automatically disconnect after five minutes has elapsed.</p>
        <h4 class="mb-2 mt-4">How do I get access to my recording?</h4>
        <p class="lead mb-2">At the end of your call we'll automatically send you an email with a link to your securely-stored recording.</p>
        <p class="lead mb-0">You can also access any of your saved recordings at any time by going to your secure account dashboard.</p>
        <h4 class="mb-2 mt-4">How does the billing and payment work?</h4>
        <p class="lead mb-2">You'll be charged 15&#162; per minute for your call recording. Billing starts from the moment the other party picks up the phone and stops when you end the call.</p>
        <p class="lead mb-2">Payment on your account is settled on a monthly basis based on your usage. You only pay for what you use at 15&#162; per minute. If you don't use the service, you don't pay anything.</p>
        <p class="lead mb-0">Our service uses a toll free number so your telephone provider will not charge you at all for using our service.</p>
        <h4 class="mb-2 mt-4">What happens if nobody picks up?</h4>
        <p class="lead mb-0">We only start charging you from the moment your call is connected to your intended recipient at 15&#162; per minute. If nobody picks up the call then we won't charge you anything.</p>
